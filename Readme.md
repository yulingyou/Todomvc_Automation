# This is a Test Automation Challenge

## Objective
To validate that the functional requirements outline under coverage criteria
- Exist with the programme
- That a user is able to access the functionality and interact with it in a manner conducive with a todo programme
  In the absence of defined functionality, the apple reminder app we used as the bench mark
  This test plan will generate guidance on areas of weakness within the functional requirements allowing developers and test to focus resource to meet the launch deadline of  Monday 8th April
